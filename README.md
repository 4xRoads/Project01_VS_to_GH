Cloning the repository from Github (GH) into VS Code was the most successful process for pulling the repository into the IDE
Prior to submitting Commits to GH, the changes need to be staged in VS IDE
In order to push commits to GH the command >>>>feat: add cli command<<<<< is used directly for the staged commits


Next Steps
* Determine how to stage and commit multiple submissions 
* Add Node.js to environment 
* Determine how to get or feature reflected on Github ReadME as it is reflected in IDE. 
* Understand what feat: add cli command means Determine how to add folders from IDE
* See if emojis can be added to README :) 
* lost internet...
